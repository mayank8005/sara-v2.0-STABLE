# SARA (**S**mart **A**ctivated **R**esidential **A**utomation) 


    SARA is an intelligent home which is way smarter than a traditional smart home system. Intelligent home is an idea in which your home can learn from your actions and use its own intelligence to control every home appliance on its own when user instructed it to run whole home in auto-pilot mode. In addition to the traditional smart home system, it uses machine learning to learn from users past actions/habits. When the user instructs our system to run on auto-pilot mode, our system will predict user's actions using supervised learning technique and control the home appliance on its own without any human intervention.
